                    Happiest birthday to my always smiling bestieeeeeee! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ <br>
                    Duniya chahe idhar ki udhar ho jaye ya fir dimaag chahe kitna hi kharab kyu na hora ho... Tu fir bhi smile karti hai and I love it. Tere se baat karte hue alag hi maza aata hai chahe kisi bhi baare mein ho... You are one of the very few people who i actually started trusting little bit very soon.
                    <br><br>
                    At first, I used to hear about you from Avni a lot that how good of a best friend you are to her. I remember she used to say that you are a very mature, cute and smart person and perhaps, you really are too. Then, when B.A.M. was created by Avni, at first, I thought that it might get a bit awkward for you too to talk to a stranger boy but fortunately, nothing like that actually every happened. I used to think that Avni is someone I trust as best friend and so her best friend must be a good human too due to which they are so close to each other. That's more of a reason why I was able to trust u easily and I'm grateful that it was like a right decision at that time. At that time, you had been preparing for your NEET examination due to which you didn't talk much and I understood it and always wished the best for you. 
                    <br><br>
                    The first time we met really surprised me! I really didn't imagined you to be that much of a "Chota packet bada dhamaka"... I really liked your energy and your personality as a human. Although your prank of surprising me didn't work, it was actually good. I genuinely felt bad that you were alone in Avni's room, waiting for me to enter while we sat outside even if that all for a few minutes. But none the less, even though all we majorly did was sit and talk, it was a great time spent. 
                    <br><br>
                    Around December was the time when we started to talk personally more. You started to be more open about your NEET preparations and personal life. I got to know how difficult it was being for you to study hard for your NEET exam and also take care of your health and personal life. You struggled with some health issues which kept making it difficult for you to even study. But even after all that, you kept going and it made me really proud of you for not giving up and working so hard. I really admire that part of yours... Being an average student in school and then working really hard for your career is not anyone can you. You worked hard but you couldn't clear it for whatsoever reasons including the scandals, but you still didn't give up and you are still preparing and making improvements for your next attempt. I'm really proud of you.
                    <br><br>
                    After your previous attempt, when you finally had some time for yourself and you went on a trip with to enjoy, I was kinda happy for you. Although that surely didn't last long as you had to again start preparing for your next attempt. Even then, you kept working hard you don't give up. It always makes me happy whenever you feel better after sharing your thoughts and struggles with me even if it helped you very slightly. To me, hearing from you how you are working hard to be successful, how you are struggling but still keep on going, how you have many other things going on but still choose to work hard makes me feel like I'm also a part of your journey and I'm a part of a movie and I really enjoy it.
                    <br><br>
                    In June 2024, we became best friends and our trio was formed. It has been going great and I really enjoy company. In October 2024, when we finally got the chance to feel for the second time, it was an amazing experience too. I had the most fun with during that meetup and I'm really happy that you really enjoyed it too. I really look forward to meetup you in near future and make more memories together!
